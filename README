CopyFullPath by John Trimis

This program allows you to right click on any file in explorer and copy the
full path to the clipboard.

Just place it anywhere on your hard drive (program files for example) and run it once. 
It will set up all the appropriate registry entries.  Fron then on, you should be able to 
rightclick on any file and select "Copy Full Path".  The absolute path to that file will
now be in your clipboard.
